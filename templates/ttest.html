    <h1>T-test</h1>
    <p>
        <b>What is a t-test?</b>
    </p>
    <p>A t-test is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups
        to determine if they are statistically different from each other.
        It is useful when dealing with small sample sizes and is based on the
        t-distribution.
    </p>
    <p>The t-test estimates the true difference between two group means using
        the ratio of the difference in group means over the pooled standard error
        of both groups. A larger t-value shows that the difference between group
        means is greater than the pooled standard error, indicating a more significant
        difference between the groups. You can compare your calculated t-value against
        the values in a critical value chart (e.g., Student's t-table) to determine
        whether your t-value is greater than what would be expected by chance.
        If so, the null hypothesis can be rejected and the alternate hypothesis is true.
    </p> 
    <p>A t-test can only be used when comparing the means of <b>two</b> groups (i.e. pairwise
        comparison). If you want to compare more than two groups, or if you want to do
        multiple pairwise comparisons, use an ANOVA test or a post-hoc test.
    </p>
    <p>The t-test is a parametric test of difference, meaning that it makes the same 
        assumptions about your data as other parametric tests. The t-test assumes your data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are independent</li>
        <li>Are normally distributed</li>
        <li>Have a similar amount of variance within each group (homogeneity of variance)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your data donâ€™t fit these assumptions, use a nonparametric alternative
        to the t-test, such as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for data with unequal variances.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>What type of t-test should be used?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        When choosing a t-test, consider two things: whether the groups being compared come
        from a single population or two different populations, and whether you want to test
        the difference in a specific direction.

    <p>
        <b>Type of t-tests:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Independent t-test: Compares means from two different populations (e.g., amount of leaf growth in two species of plants).</li>
        <li>Paired t-test: Compares means from the same population at different times (e.g., weight loss measurements before and after a diet).</li>
        <li> One-sample t-test: Compares the mean of a single group against a known value or population mean.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>
        <b>One-tailed or two-tailed t-test?</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a <b>two-tailed t-test</b> to compare if two populations are different from one another</li>
        <li>Use a <b>one-tailed t-test</b> to know whether one population mean is less than or greater than the other</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>To perform a t-test:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Formulate Hypothesis (THIS IS IMPORTANT)</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (H0):</strong> Assumes no difference between the two group means.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1):</strong> Assumes a difference between the two group means.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Collect Data:</b>Gather data for the two groups that will be compared.</li>
        <li><b>Calculate the t-statistic:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>For an independent t-test, the formula is: $$t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1}{n_1} + \frac{s_2}{n_2}}}$$</li>
                <li>Where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>\(\bar{X}_1\) and \(\bar{X}_2\) are the sample group means.</li>
                        <li>\(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are the group standard deviation.</li>
                        <li>\(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the group sample sizes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Determine the Degrees of Freedom</b>
            <ul>
                <li>For an independent t-test: \(df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Find the Critical t-value:</b> Use a t-distribution table to find the critical value based on the chosen significance
                level (usually 0.05 for a 95% confidence interval) and degrees of freedom</li>
        <li><b>Decide:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>If the absolute value of the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value, reject the null (<b>HO</b>) hypothesis.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Report Results:</b> Include the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and conclusion regarding the hypothesis.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> Add a section here on the importance of the null and alternative hypothesis. An incorrect set of hypothesis will make or break a t-test.</p>

    <p>A simulation will go here. Users can change numbers in a data set and see how it affects the concept they just learned about. Do we need to plot 
        the table values over time? Might be good to include a table of the mean, standard deviation, number, t-statistic, and p-value?</p>
