    <h1>ANOVA Test</h1>
    <p><b>What is an ANOVA test?</b></p>
    <p>
        An ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine
        if at least one of the group means is statistically different from the others. It is particularly useful when you have
        multiple groups or conditions and you want to determine if there are significant differences between them.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it suggests that at least
        one group mean is significantly different. ANOVA provides a way to test these differences without increasing the risk of
        Type I error, which would occur if multiple t-tests were conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
        The test uses an F-statistic, which compares the variance between the groups to the variance within the groups.
        A larger F-statistic indicates that the between-group variance is much larger than the within-group variance, suggesting significant differences.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your data doesnâ€™t fit the assumptions of ANOVA, consider using non-parametric tests like the Kruskal-Wallis test.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of ANOVA:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>One-Way ANOVA:</b> Compares the means of three or more independent groups to see if at least one group mean differs from the others.</li>
        <li><b>Two-Way ANOVA:</b> Compares the means of groups based on two independent variables, and can also check for interactions between them.</li>
        <li><b>Repeated Measures ANOVA:</b> Compares the means of three or more related groups or measurements taken on the same subjects over time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Assumptions of ANOVA:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The groups being compared are independent.</li>
        <li>The data in each group are approximately normally distributed.</li>
        <li>The variance within each group is approximately equal (homogeneity of variance).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Perform an ANOVA Test:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Formulate Hypotheses:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (H0):</strong> All group means are equal.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1):</strong> At least one group mean is different.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Collect Data:</b> Gather data for the groups being compared.</li>
        <li><b>Calculate the F-statistic:</b> The F-statistic is calculated as the ratio of the variance between groups to the variance within groups. The formula is:
            $$ F = \frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}} $$
            where:
            <ul>
                <li>\( MS_{between} \) is the mean square between groups (variance between the groups).</li>
                <li>\( MS_{within} \) is the mean square within groups (variance within each group).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Find the Degrees of Freedom:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>For the between-group degrees of freedom: \( df_{between} = k - 1 \), where \( k \) is the number of groups.</li>
                <li>For the within-group degrees of freedom: \( df_{within} = N - k \), where \( N \) is the total number of observations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Determine the Critical Value:</b> Use an F-distribution table to find the critical F-value based on the chosen significance level (usually 0.05) and the degrees of freedom.</li>
        <li><b>Decide:</b> If the calculated F-statistic is greater than the critical F-value, reject the null hypothesis.</li>
        <li><b>Report Results:</b> Report the F-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and conclusion regarding the hypothesis.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Running an ANOVA Test in Python and R</h1>

    <h2>Running an ANOVA Test in Python</h2>
    <p>In Python, you can use the <code>scipy</code> library to perform an ANOVA test. Here's an example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Generate random data for three groups
group1 = np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=1, size=30)
group2 = np.random.normal(loc=7, scale=1.5, size=30)
group3 = np.random.normal(loc=6, scale=1, size=30)

# Perform the one-way ANOVA test
f_statistic, p_value = stats.f_oneway(group1, group2, group3)

# Print the results
print("F-statistic:", f_statistic)
print("P-value:", p_value)

# Determine if we reject the null hypothesis
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: The groups have significantly different means.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: The groups do not have significantly different means.")
    </code></pre>
    <p>This code generates random data for three groups, runs the one-way ANOVA test, and outputs the F-statistic and p-value to determine if there is a significant difference between the groups.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Running an ANOVA Test in R</h2>
    <p>In R, you can use the <code>anova()</code> function to perform an ANOVA test. Here's an example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>
# Generate random data for three groups
group1 <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 1)
group2 <- rnorm(30, mean = 7, sd = 1.5)
group3 <- rnorm(30, mean = 6, sd = 1)

# Combine the data into a data frame
data <- data.frame(values = c(group1, group2, group3),
                   groups = factor(rep(c("Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3"), each = 30)))

# Perform the one-way ANOVA test
anova_result <- aov(values ~ groups, data = data)

# Print the summary of the ANOVA test
summary(anova_result)

# Check the p-value
if (summary(anova_result)[[1]]$`Pr(>F)`[1] < 0.05) {
  print("Reject the null hypothesis: The groups have significantly different means.")
} else {
  print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: The groups do not have significantly different means.")
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>This R code generates random data for three groups, performs the one-way ANOVA test, and uses the <code>summary()</code> function to determine if there is a significant difference between the groups.</p>
