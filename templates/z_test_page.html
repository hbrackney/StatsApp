    <h1>Z-test</h1>
    <h2>What is a Z-test?</h2>
    <p> A z-test is used to determine if there's a significant difference between the means of two groups or between a sample mean and a known population mean. It assumes the data follows a normal distribution and the population variance is known. Z-tests are typically used when the sample size is large (n â‰¥ 30). </p>
    
    <p>A simulation will go here eventually. Users can change numbers in a data set and see how it affects the concept they just learned about. </p>
