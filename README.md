## CSCI 6118 Project - Interactive App to Teach Basic Statistics to Biologists

## Project Overview

This interactive app is designed to help biologists learn and apply basic statistical concepts essential for analyzing biological data, conducting experiments, and drawing valid conclusions. Statistics is a critical tool for biologists in fields such as genetics, ecology, and epidemiology, enabling them to make evidence-based decisions and communicate findings effectively. Our app provides an easy-to-use platform for mastering key statistical techniques commonly used in biological research.

## Why Statistics for Biologists?

Biologists frequently work with large datasets, and statistical analysis helps make sense of complex biological information. The app helps users:

- Analyze biological data (e.g., gene expression, species population)
- Design experiments with scientifically rigorous methods
- Make inferences and test hypotheses
- Understand relationships between variables
- Visualize and interpret results

## Core Statistical Concepts Covered

The app provides a hands-on introduction to five key statistical methods frequently used in biological research:

### 1. **T-Tests (Two-Sample and Paired)**

T-tests compare the means of two groups to assess whether any observed differences are statistically significant.

- **Two-Sample T-Test**: Compares means of two independent groups.  
  - *Example*: Comparing plant height between two different fertilizer treatments.

- **Paired T-Test**: Compares measurements from the same group under two conditions.  
  - *Example*: Measuring before-and-after weight changes in fish exposed to a drug.

### 2. **Z-Test**

The z-test compares a sample mean to a population mean, typically used when the sample size is large.

- *Example*: Testing if the average height of a species of tree has changed compared to historical data.

![Z-Test](static/images/Z-test_screenshot.png)

### 3. **Data Distributions**

Understanding data distributions is key to selecting the right statistical tests.

- **Normal Distribution**: Often used to model biological data such as body sizes or enzyme activity.  
  - *Example*: Determining probabilities of measuring a certain enzyme level in a sample.

- **Binomial & Poisson Distributions**: Used for categorical or count-based data.  
  - *Example*: Modeling the probability of an event occurring (e.g., a species' presence in different habitats).

### 4. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**

ANOVA tests whether there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups.

- **One-Way ANOVA**: Compares the means across multiple groups for one factor.  
  - *Example*: Comparing plant growth under different light conditions.

- **Two-Way ANOVA**: Evaluates two independent variables and their interaction.  
  - *Example*: Examining how both water and fertilizer affect plant growth.

### 5. **Regression Analysis (Linear and Multiple)**

Regression helps to model relationships between variables.

- **Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between one independent and one dependent variable.  
  - *Example*: Modeling the effect of temperature on algae growth.

- **Multiple Regression**: Assesses multiple predictors simultaneously.  
  - *Example*: Analyzing how light, temperature, and soil type together affect plant growth.

## Interactive Features

The app incorporates several engaging, interactive features to enhance the learning experience:

- **Data Visualizations**: Interactive graphs (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to help users visualize distributions, regression lines, and test results.
- **Code Examples and Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step guides and sample code to show users how to apply statistical tests in practice.
- **Quiz**: A built-in quiz feature to test knowledge, with immediate feedback to reinforce concepts and improve understanding.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Ecology**: A biologist compares species diversity in two habitats using a **t-test** to determine if the difference is significant.
2. **Genetics**: A researcher tests if a new drug affects the growth of bacteria using a **z-test** to compare growth rates.
3. **Clinical Trials**: An **ANOVA** is used to test the effects of three drug treatments on patient outcomes.
4. **Environmental Science**: A study uses **linear regression** to predict plant growth based on temperature data.

## Conclusion

This app provides biologists with the statistical tools they need to analyze data, design experiments, and draw meaningful conclusions. By focusing on essential techniques like t-tests, z-tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis, the app helps users build a strong foundation in statistics, making complex data more accessible and interpretable.
